Start the container first:

Copy

Launch Waydroid In Multi-Window Mode:
First we need to set the property while a Waydroid session is running:

Copy
waydroid prop set persist.waydroid.multi_windows true
After that, we can restart the session:

Copy
waydroid session stop
Then we are ready to launch an app, and it will start in multi-window mode

First, make sure you have stopped the session and containers:
